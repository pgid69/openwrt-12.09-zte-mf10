# openwrt-12.09-zte-mf10

This repository contains only a patch to apply on OpenWrt sources, version 12.09 (Attitude Adujustment), to add support to router ZTE-MF10.

The router has only 16 MB of memory, so i think it's useless to try to port this patch to more recent version of OpenWrt.
Some people on this [forum](http://foro.seguridadwireless.net/openwrt/flashear-xte-mf10/) tried to run OpenWrt 14.07 and failed.

Just for information i added the configuration i used to generate OpenWrt firmware. It's tailored to use the router as a Wifi gateway.
